# opendata-download-radar

**I am not working on this anymore. Maybe in the future.**

Status: proof-of-concept, not even alpha

A drop-in proxy service for colorizing grayscale radar imagery from SMHI Ã–ppna API Radar in `.tif` and converts it to `.png`.

You can run it in two modes, either serve the imagery in gray-scale
but as `.png` or you can supply a colorscheme that colorizes the
imagery for you, still serving you it as `.png`.

Downloads and colorizes and serves a 887x471 px image in < 100 ms on my laptop.

### What is this?
SMHI Open Data API does not support serving unbranded imagery unless
you use the `.tiff` format. This is problematic on platforms
such as Android because native image decoders does not support
the tiff-format.

This drop-in-replacement allows you to have the same behavior as SMHI's api,
but the only difference is that it will serve convert the tiff image into
`.png`-format and serve you it back.

## Usage
You can send a request like this to get the `.tif` image data as `.png`.
```
curl -O http://localhost:8000/api/version/latest/area/sweden/product/comp/2019/04/03/radar_1904030005
```

## Storage
The radar images are stored in `/data/{year}/{month}/{date}/{filename}.png`.

# Run
```sh
cargo run --release
```

## Build
Build is run in `rust:latest` image then binary is copied
to runtime image `opendata-download-radar` image.
```sh
$ docker build -t opendata-download-radar:latest .
```

### Configuration
Optional `colors.ini` can be supplied to serve colored images.
Otherwise the grayscale image will simply be returned to you
in png-format.

### Run in docker
You can run the instance via docker:
```sh
$ docker run -it --rm -v data:/data sphrak/opendata-download-radar:latest
```
